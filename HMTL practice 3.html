    <h1>What is it?</h1>
    <p>Traditional drawing, simple and practically free for <em>creative liberty</em>, pen and paper.</p>
    
    <h2>What does it contain</h2>
    <p>Nothing too special; it is just a good way to express your creativity on physical paper.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Have an idea in your head.</li>
        <li>Get a pen/pencil and paper.</li>
        <li>Draw a <em><strong>thumbnail</strong></em> so you can quickly draft our your idea.</li>
        <li>Then draw out the basic shapes to break down complex forms.</li>
        <li>You will then draw out the details and complex nuances as you build up the image.</li>
    </ol>
   
    <h3>Why do I like it?</h3>
    <p>It is just easier to use and I don't need a digital setup to draw.</p>
    <p>Here's a list of why I think traditional drawings are good:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Traditional drawings cannot really be stolen by <strong>AI</strong> unlike digital drawings.</li>
        <li>It feels <em>"grounded"</em> and normal to draw with.</li>
        <li>It is inexpensive and easier to learn to and adapt to for beginners.</li>
    </ul>

<p>I don't hate digital art nor digital users, I think they're fantastic and useful for modern art now.</p>
